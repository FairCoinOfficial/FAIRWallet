/**
 * Tests for the FAIR price fetcher.
 *
 * The case that matters most is the FIRST one: the exact body
 * `https://explorer.fairco.in/api/price` returns today. The previous parser read
 * `data.price.usd` and `data.change_24h.usd`, neither of which the server has
 * ever sent; because `data.price` is a truthy number the `if (!data.price)`
 * guard never fired, so `usd` came out `undefined` and every fiat figure in the
 * app rendered as `NaN`. A test that asserts against a hand-written fixture of
 * the shape the code expects would have passed throughout — so the fixture here
 * is a real captured response, extra fields and all.
 *
 * `fetchPrice` deliberately never throws (it backs a `useSyncExternalStore`
 * snapshot, not a React Query fetcher), so every failure path is asserted as
 * "the last good quote survives" rather than as a rejection. The module-level
 * cache that makes that possible is shared across tests, so each test below
 * establishes the cache state it needs rather than relying on the file's order.
